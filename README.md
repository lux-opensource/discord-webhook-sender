# Webhook Sender
- You can either send a single message, or you can use the spammer function. The way the spammer function works is simply you load usernames VIA a textfile, and however amount of usernames it will send to the webhook.
- ⚠️ It is recommended you use a VPN for spammer if you spam 15+ times, as discord will ratelimit you.
